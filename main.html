      <p>
        To locate countries of interest, you can zoom in and out on the map.
        The most recent figures for COVID-19 cases per million people in each nation are shown on the map as colours
        and circles.
        <br />
        <br />
        The line charts will be updated to reflect the data for the selected country when you click it on the map.
       You can choose the property displayed on each line chart from the dropdown menus that are accessible, and you 
       can also change the horizontal axis of all charts in a similar way.
        <br />
        <br />
       To compare the impact of COVID-19 on a country's population with country summary statistics, 
        scatter graphs are also available.
        By clicking and dragging a box over them, points can be highlighted for comparison across 
        the plots and coloured according to the results of the k-means clustering analysis.
